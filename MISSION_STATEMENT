Herein, I list my goals in completion of Cryptopals challenge.


1)

Unforseen consequences notwithstanding, the parties here discussed will complete, to their best efforts, all sets of Cryptopals challenges in JAVA. 

2)

The parties shall have no time constraints or limits. Exercises are to be completed as deemed possible, and shall not take precedense over Interview question exercises unless at least two hours of deep, uninterrupted work have already been on on said exercises that day.

3)

The point of these exercises is to learn to

	a) use cryptography libraries
	b) understand the basics of implementetations, detection, and attacks
	c) hopefully net me a sweet job someday involving beautifully mathematical code
